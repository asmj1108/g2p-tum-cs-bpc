# Unified Dataset

> ### Note
> - Data from 2021 and beyond were preprocessed using consistent methods and have higher quality than data from 2020 due
> to quality assurance procedures
> - All datasets are randomly split into 80% training data, 10% development data, and 10% test data
> - For ben/bur/ger/gle/ita/per/swe/tgl/tha/ukr (the target languages of the 2022 task), the test set values were 
> independently obtained by our team and may have undergone different preprocessing methods than the original train and
> dev data set
